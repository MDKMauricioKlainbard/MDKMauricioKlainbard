# Hello everyone! üòÉ

## Who am I? üßê

My name is Mauricio Daniel Klainbard; I'm from Argentina, Mendoza, and I'm 21 years old. I'm a student of programming and engineering, passionate about logic and data handling‚Äîtwo areas that have shaped who I am today.

Currently, I am delving into new technologies, libraries, and frameworks, although I already possess solid knowledge in React, Express, JavaScript, Node, among others.

One of my strengths lies in teamwork. I pride myself on being an excellent team player, capable of fostering camaraderie and optimism in the face of every challenge that arises within my group. I firmly believe that every problem has its solution; it's just a matter of thinking calmly.

I approach each project with enthusiasm and commitment, aiming not only for efficient solutions but also to build a collaborative and positive environment. I'm excited to continue learning and contribute to the world of software development.
